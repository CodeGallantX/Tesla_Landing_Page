# Tesla Clone (React & React Router Project):

This GitHub repository showcases my Tesla Clone project developed using React and React Router. The project is already hosted and available for exploration. With this clone, I've honed my web development skills and added another impressive project to my portfolio. Feel free to check out the live version and browse the code to see how React and React Router were used to recreate the Tesla website.
